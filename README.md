# Exercices_Csharp
These are basic C# exercises that we did in a study group after the class, each student made their code.

##

The first exercise was as follows:

Write a C# Sharp program to print the result of the specified operations.
Test data:
• -1 + 4 * 6
• ( 35+ 5 ) % 7
• 14 + -4 * 6 / 11
• 2 + 15 / 6 * 1 - 7 % 2
Expected Output:
23
5
12
3

This is a variation of exercise 1, where the user must choose the numbers and the desired operation:

Exercise 2: 

Write a C# Sharp program to swap two numbers.
Test Data:
Input the First Number : 5
Input the Second Number : 6
Expected Output:
After Swapping :
First Number : 6
Second Number : 5

Exercise 3:

Write a C# Sharp program to print on screen the output of adding, 
subtracting, multiplying and dividing of two numbers which will be entered by 
the user.
Test Data:
Input the first number: 25
Input the second number: 4
Expected Output:
25 + 4 = 29
25 - 4 = 21
25 x 4 = 100
25 / 4 = 6
25 mod 4 = 1

Exercice 4:

 Write a C# Sharp program that takes a number as input and print its 
multiplication table. 
Test Data:
Enter the number: 5
Expected Output:
5 * 0 = 0
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
....
5 * 10 = 50
